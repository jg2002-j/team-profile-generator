# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project allowed me to hone my skills with npm, inquirer and node.js - and developed familiarity with test-driven development by writing code that had to pass the tests provided. By collecting user responses with inquirer, I then processed the data and accordingly wrote it to a HTML file to display the members of a team.
